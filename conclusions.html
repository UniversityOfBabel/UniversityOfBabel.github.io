<p>After two weeks we're finally done with the project!</p>
<p>The topic Calligraphy was to me unknown. The project was for me not quite clear at the beginning and I think meybe it wasn't suppose to be it either. I quickly learned that being on time in Turkey (according to Swedish being on time) doesnt't exsist. After the brainstormingpart I learned a bit more about the topic which made it easiier to continue. I didnt feel that I had problems in working in a group even tough I felt that some of the communications lead to misunderstandings. I've never worked on a projekt together with people from mixed countries. For me it was interesting and it's always good trying to improve my english. The project went on quit fluently and the feedback from the teachers was needed. The second week was the actual workingpart and it was a bit stressy in the end. The schedule was good planned but for the next time I think the being- on time-thing should be more seriously taken. My overall view of the project is positive tough.</p>

<p>I'm so happy to finish this project in those summer days.Finally...</p>
<p>I worked in a lot of international groups before and made a lot of project together with the many kind of teams but they were really professional teams about working .But the school thing is my second. But this time the problems were too many and nobody tried to solve them properly. That wasn't good motivation for me. Although some of these things, I had fun to being together with another brains and cultures also. I like to meet different perspectives because it is needed for me to develop my skills. I learned so many things about their lives, cultures, knowledges and the perspectives also...</p>
<p>And now, I'm so tired, sleepless, my eyes in pain, have a headache which is make me stressful, I will say goodbye to my friends and team members this evening, then go back to sleep for two days contuniously :)</p>
<p>Well, nice to meet you my team-mates and hope to see you again.</p>
<p>Bye</p>
<p>..</p>

<h4>... working in an international team ...</h4>
<p>discussing in a group can sometimes be hard anyway because everyone has a different view on a topic and thus it is difficult to describe what is on one's mind. talking in a group of people who are from different cultural backgrounds makes such a discussion even harder. but still on an overall view i felt that i could still express myself and say what i wanted. we also had fun while trying to explain ourselves. :) although i guess we all sometimes had the feeling that things weren't going right... but i guess in the end it all turned out fine.</p>
<h4>... the project ...</h4>
<p>the idea was inspired by calligraphy, the kadir has university building as well as our backgrounds as young interaction designers - couldn#t be any better I guess - the output therefore is a highflying concept with a down to earth prototype. I had fun working on the concept together with the others. researching, trying out the protoype was a good experience ...</p>
<h4>... calligraphy ...</h4>
<p>understanding otoman calligrahy within two weeks is impossible i guess but i think we got some understanding otoman calligrahy within two weeks is impossible i guess, but i think we got some insight on it, so if we want we can go from here - getting into the topic and then just so soon let go again was hard for some ... but i think we were able to manage</p>

<p>What a great two weeks. It started with calligraphy officially, but quickly the projects made a shift to communication in any way, so did ours. Personally I also made this shift, which was great to experience. The past few months I've been more and more thinking about communication and also encountered a lot of situations in which it played an important role. And then came this project.</p>
<p>I really liked working with Andreas, Armagan and Birgit and all the other cultures they brought in to the project. Not only social cultures but also the way everyone looked at calligraphy, interaction, communication, group processes, etc.</p>
<p>In the last two working days I tried some things out in getting a good working atmosphere. I created a post-it wall which I saw on some blog some time ago and creating this conclusions page. The post-it wall is a reverted todo-list, you put everything you're done with on a post-it and on the wall. The wall is in front of you during the work so it motivates you with all the work you've already done. For me it worked really great and I'm going to create one at home to :)</p>
<p>My part was doing research about bacteria, writing out the concept, writing a user scenario, giving the mid-presentation and helping in the final presentation, making the website and filling the blog with the process, which the others also did of course. I liked the documenting part a lot, I find it relatively easy to write and I like to write in a way everyone understands, I hope I also succeeded in that :) Further the presentation went very well too and I like telling a story in a funny and physical way to people. At last the blog was very great to do, it helped me get things out of my mind and on paper and in that way also creating structure to my thoughts.</p>
<p>It feels strange to leave this group after these two weeks. It is so much fun to be together with this group with different interests but also the common interest in interaction. I'm glad that there are some plans about visiting each other in the coming periods. Personally I think about studying for half a year at the university in Sweden.. We'll see.</p>
<p>Thanks to my team members! I hope to see again you some time in life!</p>
