text = "Armagan Kösecioglu from the Kadir Has University in Turkey is in room Z01 working on a project about calligraphy. He is working together with students from the Mälardalen University in Sweden. Armagan wants to send a sentence to the Swedish students explaining where the word calligraphy comes from.
Armagan dips his right index finger in a cup of bacteria standing on his table and starts to write on his left arm. Armagan can already read and write BabelLanguage and thus starts to write the following message:
<div class='indent'><em>Etime la vorto kaligrafio</em> ..</div>
The letters appear on his arm as he is writing with his index finger. Now his arm is already full but the message isn't finished yet. Armagan touches his left wrist and the text disappears from his arm. He continues with the rest:
<div class='indent'>.. <em>estas kunmetajo el du</em> ..</div>
But again his arm is full. He repeats the same process of touching his wrist and starts over with the last two lines of the sentence:
<div class='indent'>.. <em>grekaj vortoj: kalos esta</em> ..</div>
<div class='indent'>.. <em>bela kaj grafos esta skribo.</em></div>
He touches his wrist one more time, the text disappears and he dips his finger in a cup of water standing next to the cup with bacteria. He now continues to work on his animation which he has to finish before 13.00. Hurry..
<div class='indent'><em>The bacteria on his arm spread the message via other bacteria on the ground and walls in the university towards the minaret on top of the building. There the message will get send via GSM signals to Sweden.</em></div>
<div class='indent'><em>The Christian church tower on top of the Mälardalen University receive the GSM signals. The tower then activate bacteria on the wall in a room. These bacteria start to order them selfs in a pattern.</em></div>
Andreas Bernstein from the Mälardalen University is sitting in room L354 with other students working on a project about calligraphy. The walls around him display a script with round letters. This gives a nice atmosphere in the room.
Suddenly the text on one of the walls start to disappear and a new text comes up. Andreas looks at the wall and reads the text. It comes from the Turkish university which is participating in the same project. The text reads (in a Georgian alphabet):
<div class='indent'><em>Etime la vorto kaligrafio estas kunmetajo el du grekaj vortoj: kalos esta bela kaj grafos esta skribo.</em></div>
Andreas now knows that the word calligraphy comes from the Greek words <em>kallos</em> and <em>graphos</em>, which means &quot;beauty writing&quot;.
