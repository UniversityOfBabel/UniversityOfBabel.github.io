I like to search everything which I wonder in the world, traveling other countries to learn their culture, taking pictures with my camera and stock them all. I like different kind of music like soundtracks or the world ethnic musics. Like to play different insturments especially percussion.

<h5>Professional interests</h5>
I like to observer people, how they act, what they do, and why they do something. This results in a interest for usability and creating user-friendly artifacts. I also find joy in knowledge transfer in any way; teaching others what I know, documenting what I did and researching what others discovered, writing about this process and in this way give my knowledge back to the community.
<h5>Skills/specialization</h5>
I'm pretty good creating web-thingies in xhtml, css, php and mysql. Thus designing a user interface, let users put content up, collect this data, and represent it somewhere else in another way to the viewer. Im not skilled in computer design (as in graphics), I can draw (with a pencil) but not with the computer. I have a lot of knowledge of virtual 3D environments (MUVEs), mainly of the Active Worlds software.
<h5>Other personal info you want to share</h5>
Listening to music is important! A bit of everything; Eels, Enya, Iggy Pop, Ladytron, Manu Chao, Massive Attack, Matrix, Philip Glass, Ravi Shankar, St. Germain, Vangelis, and many more. Further I like cycling or walking or 'being' in the nature. In my spare-time I teach pupils how to create school projects in a virtual 3D world and I like to spend some time in these worlds myself to.
