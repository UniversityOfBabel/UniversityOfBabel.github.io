<em>From the supervisors</em>

We got a first round of critique from the supervisors.
<ul>
<li>There are too many different things, so choose! For example cut the communication between universities. Mainly focus on the things that the user can interact with.<br /><br />We already cut the communication between the universities and two of the extra's (gods and media companies). We might also need to cut on the communication between the towers and the bacteria and between the bacteria for personal messages. Then we can focus on the interaction of the user when writing and reading messages.<br /><br /></li>
<li>What happens when washing your hands?</li>
<li>Maybe take a look at OLED displays instead of bacteria. OLED displays will also be affordable in a few years.</li>
<li>Maybe Peter Hoffman could inspire us. He created a bacteria painting.</li>
<li>The OLED and the painting from Peter Hoffman could be combined to some agar-agar display?</li>
<li>Take a look at the Game of Life.</li>
<li>We need to get the poster finished at Thursday at 17.00.</li>
</ul>
