Here you can read our research and concept about creating a organization which helps students communicate better. We do this by learning them about other cultures and hope that this will lead to better understanding of each other and thus better communication.
During the project we also used a blog for keeping up with the process, which you can find on <a href='http://idss2008-a.blogspot.com/'>idss2008-a @ blogspot</a>. Further we used a wiki to have a central place for all documentation, you can read this on <a href='http://universityofbabel.jottit.com/'>universitityofbabel @ jottit</a>.
On this website you can find the final documentation of our project, this can also be viewed in the <a href='./media/universityofbabel.pdf'>documentation pdf</a>. The concept is created on the IDSS2008: Interaction Design Summer School 2008 held in Istanbul, Turkey. "
